# Jarans-TicTacToe

We got a task to build a TicTacToe game for android.

## The task required the app to include:

* A database
* Player game history
* The use of fragments
* An external API
* The ability to play alone against an AI
* The ability to play twoplayer
* Scores

The application has integrated facebooks API to allow the user to log in with their facebook name. They also have the option to share game results on facebook. The AI is programmed to never let the user win.
